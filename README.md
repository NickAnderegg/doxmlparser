# doxmlparser

This is a python package to make it easier to parse the XML output produced by doxygen. This package was forked from the `doxmlparser` add-on in the [doxygen source repo](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/tree/master/addon/doxmlparser).

## Upstream Fork

The initial upstream repo was generated by cloning the `doxygen` source repo and filtering it with `git filter-repo`:

```bash
# Clone the origin doxygen repo to a new directory
git clone git@github.com:doxygen/doxygen.git doxygen-doxmlparser
cd doxygen-doxmlparser

# Filter the contents of the repo down to the content of `addon/doxmlparser/`
git filter-repo --force --path addon/doxmlparser/ --path-rename addon/doxmlparser/:''

# Add the new filtered repo upstream, from which other repositories can be forked.
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:nickanderegg-upstream-forks/doxygen-doxmlparser.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Original README

The API is generated from the index.xsd and compound.xsd XML schema files using
Dave Kuhlman's generateDS https://www.davekuhlman.org/generateDS.html
